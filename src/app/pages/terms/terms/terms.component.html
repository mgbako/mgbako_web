          <h4>Digital Assets</h4>

            <b>p.</b> As of the date of these Terms of Use, the Digital Assets

            “securities” within the meaning of the Nigerian Investments and

          <p>
            <b>q.</b> The Digital Assets do not grant to the holders thereof any
            rights commonly associated with securities ownership, such as voting

          </p>
          <p>
            <b>r.</b> The Digital Assets have no inherent or underlying monetary
            or other value and may, at any time and without warning or notice,

          </p>

          <h4>Market Risks</h4>

          <p>
            <b>u.</b> Through the Website, the Company offers a marketplace for
            the buying and selling of Digital Assets. Digital Assets and the
            markets in which such Digital Assets are traded are listed at the
            sole discretion of the Company. The Company reserves the exclusive
            right to add and remove Digital Assets and markets from the Services
            at any time.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>v.</b> In the event the market for a Digital Asset is closed or
            removed from the Services, your open orders will be cancelled, and
            your Cryptofully Account will be credited an amount equal to the
            value of the cancelled orders. If a Digital Asset is scheduled for
            removal from the Services, you will be notified and granted 25 days
            to withdraw your funds from your Cryptofully Account if permitted by
            the applicable Digital Asset or its blockchain. The Company does not
            bear any responsibility or liability to you or any other person
            whatsoever for any losses or gains incurred in connection with the
            removal of a Digital Asset or market from the Services.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>w.</b> While we strive to ensure that the marketplace is both
            fair and free, the Company cannot be held accountable for any form
            of market manipulation that may occur, whether it be within the
            marketplace made available through the Digital Asset Management
            Services, or in the worldwide marketplace for Digital Assets,
            including cryptocurrencies, as a whole.
          </p>

          <p>
            <b>x.</b> The purchase and sale of Digital Assets, particularly
            digital and virtual currencies and cryptocurrencies, involves high
            levels of speculation and risk. Due to the constant and frequent
            fluctuations in value and exchange rates, the value of your Digital
            Assets may increase or decrease at any time. The Company does not
            and cannot control the value of any Digital Assets. By creating a
            Cryptofully Account or using the Website or the Services, including
            the Digital Asset Management Services, you acknowledge and agree
            that the Company does not have any responsibility or liability to

            <b>y.</b> The prices of Digital Assets, including digital and
            virtual currencies and cryptocurrencies, are often unpredictable and
            experience swings due to a variety of reasons, including government
            interference, market conditions and speculation. The Company does
            not set the current market price for any of the Digital Assets. The
            price of Digital Assets, including cryptocurrency units traded using
            the Digital Asset Management Services platform, results directly
            from buy and sell orders placed by users.

            such information exclusively on an “as is” and “as available” basis.
            The Company makes no representations or warranties with respect to
            such information.

            <b>aa.</b> Issuers of the Digital Assets may not be subject to
            ongoing public disclosure and reporting requirements and, therefore,
            it may be difficult or impossible to obtain accurate and current
            information relating to such issuers or the Digital Assets they make
            available. Due to the foregoing, there is a risk that others trading
            in Digital Assets may be doing so while in possession of material
            non-public information relating thereto.

            will no longer support such Digital Assets and may remove such
            Digital Assets from the Services. In particular, the underlying
            technology of cryptocurrencies may change such that they are subject
            to new rules governing their operation (a “Fork”), which may result
            in more than one version of the cryptocurrency. We are not
            responsible for any consequences arising from a Fork, including any
            losses you may suffer. In the event of a Fork, we may suspend
            trading or remove from the Services any of the cryptocurrencies
            subject to or resulting from the Fork.

          <h3>5. Risk statements</h3>
          <p>
            Cryptographic tokens may be subject to expropriation and/or theft;
            hackers or other malicious groups or organizations may attempt to
            interfere with our system/network in various ways, including malware
            attacks, denial of service attacks, consensus-based attacks, Sybil
            attacks, smurfing, and spoofing which may result in the loss of your
            cryptographic tokens, the loss of your ability to access or control
            your cryptographic tokens. In such an event, there may be no remedy,
            and holders of cryptographic tokens are not guaranteed any remedy,
            refund, or compensation. The regulatory status of cryptographic
            tokens and digital assets is currently unsettled, varies among
            jurisdictions and subject to significant uncertainty. It is possible
            that in the future, certain laws, regulations, policies or rules
            relating to cryptographic tokens, digital assets, blockchain
            technology, or blockchain applications may be implemented which
            directly or indirectly affect or restrict cryptographic token
            holders’ right to acquire, own, hold, sell, convert, trade, or use
            cryptographic tokens. The uncertainty in tax legislation relating to
            cryptographic tokens and digital assets may expose cryptographic
            token holders to tax consequences associated with the use or trading
            of cryptographic token. Digital assets and financial products and
            services carry significant risks. Cryptofullyis not responsible for
            any potential loss in case of token issuer's problems. Potential
            purchasers should assess the nature of, and their own appetite for,
            relevant risks independently and consult their advisers before
            making any decisions.
