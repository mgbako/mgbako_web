          <h2 class="subtitle">How we share personal information</h2>
          <p>
            We may disclose your personal information to law enforcement and
            governmental entities when required by law or in the good-faith
            belief that such action is necessary to comply with applicable laws,
            in response to a facially valid court order, judicial or other
            government subpoena or warrant, or to otherwise cooperate with law
            enforcement or other governmental agencies. We may also disclose
            your personal information to a third party in the event of any
            potential or completed reorganization, merger, sale, joint venture,
            assignment, transfer or other disposition of all or any portion of
            our business.
          </p>
          <p>
            We rely on third party services providers to perform a variety of
            services on our behalf, such as identity verification, detection of
            fraud or security threats, telephone or technical support, payment
            card processing, hosting services, and data storage or processing,
            and we may transfer your personal information to our service
            providers for such purposes. Third party service providers have
            access to and may collect personal information only as needed to
            perform their functions and are not permitted to share or use the
            information for any other purpose.
          </p>
          <p>
            When we disclose your personal information to third parties, we take
            reasonable measures to ensure that the rules set forth in this
            Privacy Policy are complied with and that such third parties provide
            sufficient guarantees to implement appropriate technical and
            organizational measures to protect your personal information.
          </p>

          <h2 class="subtitle">Privacy of Digital Assets</h2>
          <p>
            As used herein, “Digital Asset” means a digital asset (also called a
            “cryptocurrency,” “virtual currency,” “digital currency,” or
            “digital commodity”), such as Bitcoin or Ether, which is based on
            the cryptographic protocol of a computer network that may be (i)
            centralized or decentralized, (ii) closed or open-source, and (iii)
            used as a medium of exchange and/or store of value.
          </p>

          <p>
            Please be aware that Bitcoin, Ether, and other Digital Assets are
            not necessarily truly anonymous. Generally, anyone can see the
            balance and transaction history of any public Digital Asset address.
            We, and any others who can match your public Digital Asset address
            to other information about you, may be able to identify you from a
            blockchain transaction. This is because, in some circumstances,
            information published on a block chain (such as your Digital Asset
            and IP address) can be correlated with information that we and
            others may have. This may be the case even if we, or they, were not
            involved in the blockchain transaction. Furthermore, by using data
            analysis techniques on a given blockchain, it may be possible to
            identify other information about you. As part of our security,
            anti-fraud and/or identity verification and authentication checks,
            we may conduct such analysis to process such information about you.
            You acknowledge and agree to allow us to perform such practices.
          </p>

          <h2 class="subtitle">Information Security</h2>
          <p>
            We take your privacy very seriously and have implemented physical,
            organizational and technological security measures with a view to
            protecting your personal information from loss or theft,
            unauthorized access, disclosure, copying, use or modification. In
            particular, we encrypt the Cryptofully website with SSL; we require
            two-factor authentication for all user sessions; we periodically
            review information collection, storage, and processing practices;
            and we restrict access to your information on a need-to-know basis
            for our employees, contractors, and agents who are subject to strict
            contractual confidentiality obligations and may be disciplined or
            terminated if they fail to meet these obligations.
          </p>

          <p>
            Despite the measures outlined above, no method of information
            transmission or information storage is 100% secure or error-free, so
            we unfortunately cannot guarantee absolute security. If you have
            reason to believe that your interaction with us is no longer secure
            (for example, if you feel that the security of any information that
            you provided to us has been compromised), please contact us
            immediately using the contact information in the “Contact Us”
            section below.
          </p>

          <h2 class="subtitle">Retention of personal information</h2>
          <p>
            We will use, disclose or retain your personal information only for
            as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which that personal
            information was collected and as permitted or required by law.
          </p>

          <h2 class="subtitle">Rights regarding your Personal Information</h2>
          <p>
            Under certain circumstances and in accordance with the Act and the
            NDPR or other applicable data protection laws, you have the

          <h2 class="subtitle">Direct Marketing</h2>
          <p>
            Subject to applicable laws and regulations, we may from time to time
            send direct marketing materials promoting services, products,
            facilities, or activities to you using information collected from
            you. If you no longer want to receive marketing-related
            communications from us, you may opt-out of such communications by
            clicking the “unsubscribe” link at the bottom of emails you receive
            from us. You may also opt-out by contacting us directly using the

            that you please allow us reasonable time to process your request. We
            will not provide your information to third parties for direct
            marketing or other unrelated purposes without your written consent.
          </p>
          <p>
            Please note that if you opt-out from receiving marketing-related
            communications, we may still need to send you communications about
            your use of our products or services, or other matters, subject to
            applicable laws and regulations.
          </p>

          <h2 class="subtitle">Data Transfer</h2>
          <p>
            Your personal information may be stored and processed in any
            country, province or state (each a “Country”) where we have
            facilities or in which we engage third party service providers. As a
            result, your personal information may be transferred to Countries
            outside your Country of residence, which may have different data
            protection rules than in your Country. While such information is
            outside of your Country, it is subject to the laws of the Country in
            which it is held, and may be subject to disclosure to the
            governments, courts or law enforcement or regulatory agencies of
            such other Country, pursuant to the laws of such Country. However,
            our practices regarding your personal information will at all times
            continue to be governed by this Privacy Policy and we will comply
            with the NDPR requirements of providing adequate protection for the
            transfer of personal information.
